                        Based on:<br>
                        Jeremiah 17:7-8 <br>
                        “But blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord,
                            whose confidence is in him.
                        They will be like a tree planted by the water
                            that sends out its roots by the stream.
                        It does not fear when heat comes;
                            its leaves are always green.
                        It has no worries in a year of drought
                            and never fails to bear fruit.”<br><br>
                        
                        and Psalm 1:1-3<br>
                         
                        Blessed is the one
                            who does not walk in step with the wicked
                        or stand in the way that sinners take
                            or sit in the company of mockers,
                        but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
                            and who meditates on his law day and night.
                        That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
                            which yields its fruit in season
                        and whose leaf does not wither—
                            whatever they do prospers.</p>
                        
                        <p>When trials and tests come, we tend to be afraid, to wonder how we are going to get through this, but the Word of God says that if we trust in Him, we have no need to fear because when we trust Him, have faith in Him, we are like trees planted by streams of water.
                        God is our provider, he has everything under control, if we have Him, we have everything we need to go through the test, the trial, the heat.<br>
                        <br>
                        Sometimes in life , it feels like we are going through a drought - a dry place, a hard time, a time when it seems that we don't have what we need for life, what we need to survive this drought, but we don't have the same sources as those in the world , our source is God. God who is ALL POWERFUL, for whom NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE!<br>
                        <br>
                        Therefore, as long as we continue to put our trust and confidence in Him, WE WILL NEVER FAIL TO BEAR FRUIT!
                        HALLELUJAH!!!

                    <h2>Crossing the Reed [Red] Sea AGAIN</h2>
                    <p class="author_date">September 14, 2020 by Joy</p>
                    <p> <img class="pgImg" src="RedSeaParted.webp" width=150px height=150px>For the most part, we all know the story of how Israel crossed the Reed (Red) Sea ( Exodus 14-15 ),       but did you know that God performed (almost) the SAME miracle AGAIN in Joshua 3-4 ( http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+3 )<br><br>
                        Here a few interesting revelations concerning this passage:<br>
                        .....“When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God...... you are to move out from your positions and follow it. <br><br>
                        
                        Since the ark of the covenant represents The Lord's Throne, it means that The Lord Himself went into the Jordan ahead of His people as He led them into the land of rest. 
                        Isn't that amazing? Praise God!
                    </p>
                    <p>The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord stopped in the middle of the Jordan and stood on dry ground,while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground.This signifies that The Lord Himself remained in the place of danger until all Israel had crossed the Jordan.<p>
                    <p>Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge, the water from upstream stopped flowing. 
                        It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.</p>

                    <p>Wowwwww!!!! Amen!! <br><br>
                        
                        I'd just like to point out something else :<br></p>
                        
                    <p>Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you.”</p>
                        
                    <p></p>What it's saying is that God cannot do amazing things among us when we are not in rightsatnding with him. So if you want God to do amazing things in and through you, then you must consecrate yourself before him, live a life that is pleasing in his sight.
